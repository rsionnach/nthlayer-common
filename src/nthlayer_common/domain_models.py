"""
Core domain models.

Canonical source for shared domain types (Run, Finding, Team, Service).
Uses Pydantic (BaseModel) rather than dataclasses — these are API/persistence
boundary types that benefit from Pydantic's validation and serialization.
Phase 0 migration: nthlayer.domain.models is a backward-compat re-export shim.
